# CSV File Reader
Welcome to the CSV File Reader, a simple backend system built with Node.js and TypeScript to read and display the contents of CSV files.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Node.js is the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side, enabling us to build server applications using JavaScript.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript, providing type safety and enhancing code quality by catching errors at compile-time.

- **csv-parser**: The `csv-parser` library simplifies the process of parsing CSV files and converting them into JavaScript objects, making it easier to read and handle CSV data.

The directory structure of this backend project is as follows:
- **app.ts**: The `app.ts` file serves as the entry point for the backend application. Within this file, you'll configure and start your Node.js server. It's also where you'll implement the logic to read and process CSV files.

- **data**: The `data` directory serves as a storage location for data files. Specifically, it contains the `demo.csv` file.

- **demo.csv**: The `demo.csv` file is a standard CSV (Comma-Separated Values) data file. In CSV files, each line typically represents a row of data, and values within each row are separated by commas. It's common to define headers in the first row to represent the columns, with subsequent rows containing data entries. In the context of this project, `demo.csv` likely contains sample data that your backend application will read and process.

## Getting Started
To run the backend locally and explore its capabilities, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `csv-file-reader` directory.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the TypeScript code:
   ```
   npx tsc
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```
   node dist/app.js
   ```
The backend server will be up and running, ready to read and process CSV files.
Feel free to customize and expand the functionality of this backend application to suit your specific needs. You can enhance it to support various CSV files and data processing tasks as required.
